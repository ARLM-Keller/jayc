**Jay for C#** is the Mono Project's version of Jay. It generates C# based parsers for programming languages.

NOTE: This is the exact same version of Jay in the Mono source tree. It's hard to find it though and even harder to build on Windows. This project simply makes it convenient to find and provides a Visual Studio-based build solution.
